        <h1>Neon District Spine Three.JS Examples</h1>

        <p>
          The examples in this package serve to provide a foundation for building on a series of
          Three.JS modules for Neon District's web implementation. In order to build rapidly and safely,
          and to follow proper separation of concerns, we are attempting to package all of the Neon
          District animation modules as a standalone set of React modules.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are not certain that this is the correct path forward, but we're going to try it anyway.
